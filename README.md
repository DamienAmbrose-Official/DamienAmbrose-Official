## About
<p>A 12-year-old self-taught web developer. I started programming a couple years ago, and oh boy, has it been a rollercoaster! I really want to become a Full Stack developer but without that much help from basically anyone, it hasn’t been that easy, to say the least. I’m mainly a frontend developer and use GitHub primarily to host sites. And yes, all my projects are open source, so feel free to dig around in the source code! I’m also into Blender and Unity, so, get ready for some pretty mediocre (to downright painful) games coming into my profile!<p>
