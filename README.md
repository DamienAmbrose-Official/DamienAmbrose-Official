<p>Hi, I'm Damien Ambrose, a 12-year-old web enthusiast with a passion for UI/UX. I'm a self-taught programmer, artist and student. I started programming a couple years ago, and oh boy, has it been a rollercoaster! I really want to become a Full Stack developer but without that much help from basically anyone, it hasnâ€™t been that easy. 

 Iâ€™m mainly a frontend developer and use GitHub primarily to host sites. And yes, all my projects are open source, so feel free to dig around in the source code! Iâ€™m also into Blender and Unity, so expect some pretty mediocre (to downright painful) games to sneak into my pins. And no, I'm not going to replace web development with game development anytime soon.


 Feel free to contact me at <a href="#">damienambrose@outlook.com</a>, especially for a bug reports and feature suggestions. You can also send me ideas for future projects, and even make remixed versions of my own projects! If you want to make your stuff based on my work, feel free, but please give me proper credit and link back to me!

<p>
