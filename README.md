## About
<p>Hey! I'm Damien Ambrose- an 11 year old self-taught web developer who makes cool stuff, or at least tries! As of now, I'm in 6<sup>th</sup> grade as I'm writing this.
My attitiute towards programming and Javascript in perticular is try it myself. It's much more fun that googling and who knows? Maybe 0.01% of the time it'll work!
I have what I like to call great website designing skills, but not so much in putting it into HTML and CSS. I'm trying my hand in backend programming via firebase, but I'm not sure it'll stick. I like to have a positive Outlook, or Gmail. Take your pick.</p>

<h2> Migration </h2>
<p> It's strange it's here, but trust me, it makes sense. My old account was called "DamienAmbrose." Pretty standard, right? But after a lot of personal migration, my emai was changed and so, a new GitHub profile. What matters is that things are here, and the old account will be taken down, soon, so better stay updated! And by the way, my name's going to become normal soon, too. No more "official."</p>
 
 <blockquote> I need your help
 
<br>
I am relatively new to github, so much so I wrote this in HTML markup, not github markdown. If you found anything wrong, tag me (is that how it works?) or at least email me. Don't forget to remind me that you're from github. Be nice. Please.
<br>
 <br>
 Before I forget, the portfolio is on the to-do list. Stay calm.

Git going, or git gone!
