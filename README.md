## About
<p>Hey! I'm Damien Ambrose- an 11 year old self-taught web developer who makes cool stuff, or at least tries! As of now, I'm in 6<sup>th</sup> grade as I'm writing this.
My attitiute towards programming and Javascript in perticular is try it myself. It's much more fun that googling and who knows? Maybe it'll work!
I have what I like to call great website designing skills, but not so much in putting it onto pen and paper, or should I say, HTML and CSS. I'm trying my hand in backend programming via firebase, but I'm not sure it'll stick. I also like to have a positive Outlook, if you havn't noticed. Or Gmail. Take your pick.</p>
