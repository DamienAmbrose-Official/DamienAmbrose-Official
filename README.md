## About
<p>Hey! I'm Damien Ambrose- an 11 year old self-taught web developer who makes cool stuff, or at least tries! As of now, I'm in 6<sup>th</sup> grade as I'm writing this.
My attitiute towards programming and Javascript in perticular is try it myself. It's much more fun that googling and who knows? Maybe 0.00001% of the time it'll work!
I have somewhat okay Javascript skills, and passable HTML and CSS. I like pizza, but not burgers, and like puns, not jokes. Plus, I like painting, not drawing.
I like to have a positive Outlook, or Gmail. Take your pick.</p>

<h2> Migration </h2>

<br>
I am relatively new to github, so much so I wrote this in HTML markup, not github markdown. If you found anything wrong, tag me (is that how it works?) or at least email me. Don't forget to remind me that you're from github. Be nice. Please.

 <br>
 Before I forget, the portfolio is on the to-do list. Stay calm.
